# Objective
- Build a data product that (1) analyzes ride-hailing operations (demand, revenue, cancellations, service quality) and (2) predicts Booking Status from booking attributes so ops can proactively reduce cancellations and improve fulfillment.
# Why this project
- Reduce cancellations & ETA failures: identify high-risk rides before assignment.
- Improve driver matching: surface vehicle type & location patterns to raise acceptance.
- Revenue planning: quantify demand peaks and high-value corridors.
- Customer experience: link CTAT/VTAT, ratings, and outcomes to guide policy changes.
# Step-by-Step Approach
- Data understanding & cleaning
- Parse dates/times; standardize formats; coerce errors to NaT.
- Audit nulls, duplicates, and inconsistent categoricals; impute or tag as "Unknown".
- Ensure numeric types for Avg VTAT, Avg CTAT, Booking Value, Ride Distance, ratings.
# Feature engineering
- From Date/Time: Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, DayOfWeek, IsWeekend, PartOfDay.
- Geography: frequency-encode Pickup Location/Drop Location; tag OD pairs and corridor popularity; distance buckets.
- Ops signals: CTAT_minus_VTAT, on-time flags, surge/peak flags (based on historical hour/day demand).
- Rare label grouping: collapse infrequent categories into "Other" to stabilize models.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time series: daily rides & revenue trends; seasonality by DoW and hour.
- Status mix: distribution of Booking Status (completed, cancelled-by-cust, cancelled-by-driver, no-show, etc.).
- Vehicle mix: usage share of Vehicle Type; acceptance vs. cancellation by type.
- Top geos: Top-10 pickup and drop clusters; OD heat.
- Cancellation reasons: customer vs driver; tie to hour/CTAT/VTAT/vehicle.
- Quality: distributions of Driver Ratings & Customer Rating.
- Correlation heatmap: numeric features ↔ Booking Value, Ride Distance, ratings, VTAT/CTAT.
- You already plotted: daily rides & revenue, status/vehicle distributions, top pickups/drops, cancellation reasons, ratings histograms, and a correlation heatmap — great coverage.
# Feature selection
- Filter: drop near-zero variance, multicollinear (|ρ|>0.9), and data-leaky fields (IDs).
- Stat tests: Mutual Information / χ² for categoricals vs target.
- Model-based: Permutation Importance / Gini Importance (Random Forest), and SHAP for tree models.
- Keep a lean set that balances accuracy and inference speed.
# Model training
- Target = Booking Status (multi-class).
- Split with Stratified train/validation/test.
- Baselines: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.
- Stronger models: Random Forest, XGBoost/Gradient Boosting, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes.
- Pipelines: label encoding (or target/frequency encoding for high-cardinality), scaling for LR/SVM/KNN.
- Hyperparameters (sketch):
- RF: n_estimators, max_depth, max_features, min_samples_leaf
- XGB: n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth, subsample, colsample_bytree
- Imbalance handling: class weights or SMOTE (train only) if cancellations are rare.
# Model evaluation (testing)
- Report accuracy + macro F1, per-class precision/recall, and confusion matrix.
- For business fit: Cancellation Recall (catch risky rides), and Precision (avoid false alarms).
- Calibration (Brier score) if you’ll threshold probabilities for interventions.
- Explainability: SHAP plots for top features and “why a booking is risky”.
- Operationalization (next steps)
- Save encoder(s), scaler, and model; wrap in a predict API.
- Decision policy: e.g., if P(cancel) > threshold → switch vehicle type, re-offer driver, prompt upfront fare, or call customer.
- Build a simple dashboard tracking status mix, hotspots, and model drift.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (what to look for & how to read it)
- Demand & revenue: Identify peaks (e.g., weekday 9–11 AM, 5–9 PM) and low-demand valleys; watch revenue decoupling from ride count (surge or longer trips).
- Status drivers: Higher Avg VTAT/Avg CTAT usually correlate with cancellations; check by hour/vehicle.
- Geos: Certain pickup hubs may show high no-show risk; pair with Hour.
- Vehicle Type: Large vehicles may have higher value but lower acceptance in off-peak.
- Ratings: Very low driver/customer ratings may tilt outcomes; verify via boxplots.
- Correlations: Expect positive between Ride Distance and Booking Value; inspect VTAT/CTAT vs status.
# Feature Selection (practical shortlist)
- Consider starting with:
- Hour, DayOfWeek, IsWeekend, Vehicle Type (encoded), Pickup Freq, Drop Freq, OD Pair Freq, Ride Distance, Booking Value, Avg VTAT, Avg CTAT, CTAT_minus_VTAT, Driver Ratings, Customer Rating, Top Cancellation Reason (encoded if known at booking)
- Remove: Booking ID and raw free-text reason columns unless properly encoded.
# Feature Engineering (you can add these quickly)
- PartOfDay: Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night.
- PeakFlag: based on historical quantiles per hour-DoW.
- Geo buckets: map locations to zones (CBD, residential, airport, etc.).
- Price normalization: Booking Value / Ride Distance.
- Recency features: rolling 7-day demand for the pickup zone (if data supports).
- Model Training (what your code already does)
- Label-encodes all categoricals; scales features; trains LR, DT, RF, NB, SVM, KNN, and optionally XGBoost.
- Uses hold-out split (80/20).
# Tips to upgrade quickly:
- Use StratifiedKFold (5x) for more stable estimates.
- Add class_weight='balanced' for LR/SVM/Tree if imbalance exists.
- Tune top models (RF/XGB) with small randomized search.
- Model Testing & Reporting (drop this cell after training)
# Metrics table (example structure):
- Model | Accuracy | Macro F1 | Cancel-Recall | Completed-Recall
- Plots: confusion matrix (normalized), ROC-AUC (one-vs-rest), and a SHAP summary for the best model.
- Business cut: choose a probability threshold that maximizes Cancel-Recall at an acceptable alert rate.
